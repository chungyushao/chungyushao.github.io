# General idea of hypothesis testing
* **Making initial assumption**:
  * Turn question of interest into hypothesis about the value of parameter(s)
  * There will be
    * `Null hypothesis` \\( H_0 \\):
      * your assumption is wrong, so there is no (null) hypothesis
      * a.k.a "status quo hypothesis"
    * `Alternative hypothesis` \\( H_a \\):
      * your initial assumption
      * a.k.a. researcher hypothesis
* **Collecting evidence (data)**.
* **deciding whether to reject the initial assumption (accept the null hypothesis) or not**.
  * Based on certain **significance level**

# Questions remain

* What are the appropriate hypothesis?
* What is an appropriate test Statistics?
* What is an appropriate significance level?
* Is there significance evidence against the null hypothesis?
* What is an appropriate conclusion to the problem?
  * Even If the evidence is strong (for supporting your initial assumption), there still be two situations:
    * the null hypothesis still valid, but you witness a unusual of evidences
    * the null hypothesis is wrong.
