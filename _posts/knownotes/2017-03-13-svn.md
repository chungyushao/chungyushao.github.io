# Terminologies
> Conventionally, every Subversion project has trunk, tags, and branches directories directly under the project's root directory.

###### Repository
* A repository is the central place where developers store all their work and the history.
* Repository is accessed over a network, acting as a server and version control tool acting as a client.
* Clients can connect to the repository, and then they can store/retrieve their changes to/from repository.
*  By storing changes, a client makes these changes available to other people and by retrieving changes, a client takes other people's changes as a working copy.

###### Trunk
* The trunk is a directory where all the main development happens and is usually checked out by developers to work on the project.

###### Tags
* The tags directory is used to store named snapshots of the project.
* Tag operation allows to give descriptive and memorable names to specific version in the repository.
* When creating a production release, the team will tag the code that goes into the release.

###### Branches
* Branch operation is used to create another line of development. It is useful when you want your development process to fork off into two different directions.

###### Working copy
* Working copy is a snapshot of the repository.
* The repository is shared by all the teams, but people do not modify it directly.
* Instead each developer checks out the working copy. The working copy is a private workplace where developers can do their work remaining isolated from the rest of the team.

###### Commit
* Commit is a process of storing changes from private workplace to central server.
* After commit, changes are made available to all the team.
* Other developers can retrieve these changes by updating their working copy.
* Commit is an atomic operation. Either the whole commit succeeds or is rolled back. Users never see half finished commit.


###### Checkout
* create a working copy from the repository.

###### Update
* 'update' operation is used to update working copy.
* This operation synchronizes the working copy with the repository

###### Status
* lists the modifications that have been made to the working copy.
* whenever you do changes in the working copy all these changes become a part of the pending change-list. And the 'status' operation is used to see the pending change-list.

###### Revert
* Operation reverts the modifications that have been made to the working copy.
* It is possible to revert one or more files/directories.
* Also it is possible to revert the whole working copy. In this case, the 'revert' operation will destroy the pending change-list and will bring the working copy back to its original state.

###### Resolve
* 'Merge' operation automatically handles everything that can be done safely. Everything else is considered as conflict.
* 'resolve' operation is used to help the user figure out things and to inform VCS about the ways of handling the conflicts.
