All markets have
* Buyers - (Demand)
* Sellers - (Supply)

**Market price**: the best price at which both buyers and sellers are happy to transact


# Supply and demand
![from preetamsushistory.wikispaces.com]({{site.url}}/images/finance/supplyndemand.png)

###### Why demand curve (Price v.s. (Demanded) Quantity)downward?
* Substitution effect: alternative goods seem relatively attractive since their price hasn't change
* Income effect: the higher the price is, the fewer people with enough income will be willing to buy it. So the demand decrease
* Diminishing marginal utility: Each additional unit has less utility than the first as you have more of the same good;
  * Explain the x-axis of quantity as "the number of that products you have after buying",
  * y-axis of price as "the price you would like to pay for the i-th product you just buy"
  * You are willing to buy the first one with the highest price since it provides you a brand new utility, however, you are likely to pay less and less as the number of products you have increase, since the marginal utility goes down.

##### Why supply curve upward
* As the price level increases, suppliers who were unable to enter the market are now able to enter, which adds to existing supply.
* As price level increases, suppliers are motivated to supply more for maximizing their earnings.
* As output of a good increases, the resources needed to produce it become scarcer, causing costs to rise (the marginal cost increases, hence the price rise.)

##### Why do prices change?
* When there is excess supply, prices drop

  * decreasing production costs
  * improving technology
  * new market participants
  * improved productivity
* When there is excess demand, prices rise

  * increased quality
  * increased Income
  * consumer preference
  * increasing population

> Economists and analysts try to understand **WHY** supply and demand levels change; Traders try to understand **WHEN** supply and demand levels change. For traders, the WHT sometimes doesn't matter.

|**Hedge accounting**|對沖會計法/ 通過對沖會計法，金融市場對沖的收益和損失的會計認可被推延至基礎風險暴露的相應收益和損失得到認可之後。由於這種方法使公司能夠將對沖成本計入風險暴露的成本基礎，因此公司一般傾向使用它。這方法將收益與損失沖銷匹配起來，從而降低了利潤的波動性，符合對沖的目的。|
|**Hedge Fund**|對衝基金；避險基金；避險基金|

# Assumptions under technical analysis of Trading
* All influences on market action are **automatically accounted for or discounted** in price activity.
* Prices move in trends and these trends tend to persist for relatively long periods of time.
* The future **can be found in the past**.

# How do we predict `when`?
1. Fundamental analysis
  * Universal economic indicators
    * Stocks: company specific, statements etc.
    * Forex: Country specific, GDP etc.
    * Commodities-inflation and demand
2. Technical analysis
  * Universal: Everything to do with charts and statistical analysis of historic price data
  * Look for trends and patterns in the movement of prices.
3. Order flow analysis - Futures/exchange traded

# Technical v.s. fundamental
* Technical: studies the **effect** of supply and demand: price, volume, sentiment, open interest over time
* Fundamental: studies the **causes** of price movement
