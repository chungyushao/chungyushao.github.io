# Security (證券)
> 本質上，證券是一種金融合約，按照投資人願意接受的價格，在市場上交易。證券的例子包括票券、股票、優先股、債券、選擇權、期貨、交換，以及認股權證等。

* A security is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that represents some type of financial value.
* A security is a financial instrument that
  (1) represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (**stock**),
  (2) a creditor relationship with governmental body or a corporation (**bond**), or
  (3) rights to ownership as represented by an **option**.
* The company or entity that issues the security is known as the issuer.
* Securities can be broadly categorized into two distinct types – debts and equities – although hybrid securities exist as well.

# Bid / Ask
* bid price is the amount a buyer will pay for a security.
* The bid price is opposed by the ask price, which is the amount a seller will accept for a security.
* A security’s current price is the last price paid for it, and it’s usually different from the bid and the ask.
* The difference between the bid price and the ask price is the spread, which indicates an asset’s liquidity, or the ease with which it can be sold.
* Especially liquid assets will have spreads that are pennies apart.

# Quote
* A quote is the last price at which a security or commodity traded, meaning the most recent price on which a buyer and seller agreed and at which some amount of the asset was transacted.
* The bid or ask quotes are the most current prices and quantities at which the shares can be bought or sold. The bid quote shows the price and quantity at which a current buyer is willing to purchase the shares, while the ask shows what a current participant is willing to sell the shares for. This is also known as an asset's "quoted price".


# Liquidity
* Liquidity describes the degree to which an asset or security can be quickly bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price.

# Market liquidity
* the extent to which a market, such as a country's stock market or a city's real estate market, allows assets to be bought and sold at stable prices. Cash is the most liquid asset, while real estate, fine art and collectibles are all relatively illiquid.



# Broker 經紀人
* A broker is an individual or firm that charges a fee or commission for executing buy and sell orders submitted by an investor.
* The role of a firm when it acts as an agent for a customer and charges the customer a commission for its services.

# Trader
* A trader is an individual who engages in the buying and selling of financial assets in any financial market, either for himself or on behalf of another person or institution. The main difference between a trader and an investor is the duration for which the person holds the asset.
  * Investors tend to have a longer-term time horizon, while traders tend to hold assets for shorter periods of time to capitalize on short-term trends.

# Dealer
* A dealer is a person or firm in the business of buying and selling securities for their own account, whether through a broker or otherwise.
* A dealer is defined by the fact that it acts as principal in trading for its own account, as opposed to a broker who acts as an agent in executing orders on behalf of its clients.
* A dealer is also distinct from a trader in that buying and selling securities is part of its regular business,
  * while a trader buys and sells securities for his or her own account but not on a business basis.

# Equity 股權/權益/股票)
一般可理解為所有者權益，也就是資產價值超過相關債務的部分。Equity = Assets - Liabilities
股票稱為equity，是因為它代表的是公司所有者(就是股東)的權益。
1. 股票或其他代表所有者權益的證券。
2. 公司資產負債表上的股東權益，代表股東貢獻的資本，以及公司的保留餘盈。
3. 保證金交易帳戶中，證券價值超過券商融資的部分。
4. 房地產市值超過房貸餘額的部分，也就是房貸戶若賣掉房產、還清貸款後所能得到的金額。
5. 就投資策略而言，是指股票資產，與固定收益證券(債券)fixed income，以及現金cash合稱三大資產類別(principal assets classes)。
  * 投資人透過適當的資產配置，建構風險與報酬符合自己需要的投資組合。

# Bid-Ask Spread
* The spread is the difference between the bid(買家希望出的價錢) and asking(賣家尋求出售的價錢) prices for a particular security.
  * Assume that Morgan Stanley Capital International wants to purchase 1,000 shares of XYZ stock at $10, and Merrill Lynch & Co. wants to sell 1,500 shares at $10.25. The spread is the difference between the asking price of $10.25 and the bid price $10, or 25 cents.
  * An individual investor looking at this spread would then know that if he wants to sell 1,000 shares, he could do so at $10 by selling to MSCI.
  * Conversely, the same investor would know that he could purchase 1,500 shares from Merrill Lynch at $10.25.
  * The size of the spread and price of the stock are determined by supply and demand.
    * The more individual investors or companies that want to buy, the more bids there will be; more sellers results in more offers or asks.
* The bid-ask spread is essentially a negotiation in progress. To be successful, traders must be willing to take a stand and walk away in the bid-ask process through limit orders.
  * By executing a market order without concern for the bid-ask and without insisting on a limit, traders are essentially confirming another trader's bid, creating a return for that trader.

# Market Maker
* A market maker is a broker-dealer firm that assumes the risk of holding a certain number of shares of a particular security in order to facilitate the trading of that security.
* Each market maker competes for customer order flow by displaying buy and sell quotations for a guaranteed number of shares, and once an order is received from a buyer, the market maker immediately sells from its own inventory or seeks an offsetting order.
* The Nasdaq is the prime example of an operation of market makers, given that there are more than 500 member firms that act as Nasdaq market makers, keeping the financial markets running efficiently.
* All market makers are compensated for the risk of holding assets. The risk they face is a decline in the value of a security after it has been purchased from a seller and before it's sold to a buyer. Therefore, market makers charge a spread on each security that they cover. This is known as the bid-ask spread and is extremely common in financial transactions.

# Liquidity Rebates
* Most exchanges have adopted a “maker-taker model” for subsidizing the provision of stock liquidity. In this model, investors and traders who put in limit orders typically receive a small rebate from the exchange upon execution of their orders because they are regarded as having contributed to liquidity in the stock, i.e. they are liquidity “makers.”
* Conversely, those who put in market orders are regarded as “takers” of liquidity and are charged a modest fee by the exchange for their orders. While the rebates are typically fractions of a cent per share, they can add up to significant amounts over the millions of shares traded daily by high-frequency traders. Many HFT firms employ trading strategies specifically designed to capture as much of the liquidity rebates as possible.

# Arbitrage (套利)
> 套利並不是一種長期投資策略，而是一種賺取短暫異常價差的短期交易策略。

* Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price.
* It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies.

# Predatory Trading
Trading practices employed by some high-frequency traders to make nearly risk-free profits at the expense of investors. In Lewis’ book, the IEX exchange, which seeks to combat some of the shadier HFT pratcices, identifies three activities that constitute predatory trading:
  * “Slow market arbitrage” or “latency arbitrage,” in which a high-frequency trader arbitrages minute price differences of stocks between various exchanges.
  * “Electronic front running,” which involves a HFT firm racing ahead of a large client order on an exchange, scooping up all the shares on offer at various other exchanges (if it is a buy order) or hitting all the bids (if it is a sell order), and then turning around and selling them to (or buying them from) the client and pocketing the difference.
  * “Rebate arbitrage” involves HFT activity that attempts to capture liquidity rebates offered by exchanges without really contributing to liquidity.

# Principal Trading and Agency Trading
* When entering an equity order on your computer or through your broker, you are, on some occasions, trading with another person through an exchange, but on other occasions you are only making a trade with your broker. These are the two main types of trades that investors will encounter: principal and agent transactions.
* Brokers are required to inform you as to whether a filled trade was an agency or principal transaction; you are usually notified in your trade confirmation sent in the mail (or electronically). Although you cannot specify to your broker how you want the trade to be filled, as a client you have the right to know how your transaction was completed.
###### Principal Trading
* Principal trading occurs when a brokerage buys securities in the secondary market, holds these securities for a period of time and then sells them. The purpose behind principal trading is for firms (also referred to as dealers) to create profits for their own portfolios through price appreciations. So when an investor buys and sells stock through a brokerage firm that acts as the principal to a trade, the firm will use its own inventory on hand to fill the order for the client. With this method brokerage firms earn extra income (over and above the commissions charged) by making money from the bid-ask spread of a particular stock.
* For instance, if you were looking to buy 100 shares of ABC at $10, the principal firm would first check its own inventory to see whether or not the shares are available to sell to you. If they are available, the firm would sell the shares to you and then report the transaction to the necessary exchange. This reporting may be, for ensuring regulations and safeguarding clients, the most important action of a principal trade. The Securities and Exchange Commission and exchanges require that the brokerage firms complete the trades at prices comparable to those of the market.

###### Agency Trading
* An agency transaction is more complicated than regular principal transactions, these deals involve the search for and transfer of securities between clients of different brokerages. The increasing number of participants in the securities market and the need for extremely accurate bookkeeping, clearing, settlement and reconciliation make ensuring the smooth flow of the securities markets quite a task.

* Agency transactions are comprised of two distinct parts.
  * First, your brokerage needs to bring your request to the appropriate market in order to find a party wishing to assume the opposite position. So, if you wish to buy at a certain price, the broker needs to find someone wishing to sell at the same price and vice versa. Once both parties are found, the exchange records the transaction on its ticker tape, and an exchange of money and securities between the parties occurs on settlement.

  * The second portion of the agency transaction occurs after the trade is completed and has been properly documented on the exchange. This portion is commonly referred to as **clearing**. While all brokers maintain individual books recording the entire amount of buy and sell orders transacted by clients, the actual act of clearing these transactions is handled by a larger institution. In North America, the institution handling the vast majority of clearing and safekeeping duties is the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC).

###### Cleaning
* The basic act of clearing involves matching buys and sells. Once the transactions are executed on the exchange, details of the trades are sent to a subsidiary of the DTCC (called the National Securities Clearing Corporation), and are subsequently recorded and matched for accuracy.
* After all the trades sent by member firms to the DTCC are matched for buys and sells, the DTCC then notifies all member firms of their associated obligations, and arranges the transfer of appropriate funds and securities. '
* Thus, rather than having individual brokers dealing with one another after every trade on a securities exchange, the DTCC acts as middleman collecting all transactions and streamlining the transfer of stocks and cash. This reduces the amount of time required for delivery and receipt of obligations and provides flexibility for brokerages in choosing dealing partners. This entire clearing process usually takes three days to complete.
* It is important to note that the DTCC not only facilitates but also guarantees delivery. If one party fails to deliver the securities or cash to the other, the DTCC will step in and fulfill the obligations of the failing party.
