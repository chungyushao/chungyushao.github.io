# Introduction
* The traditional view of a perfect frictionless market is summarized in the conventional supply and demand framework. Each buyer and seller is assumed to be atomistic, that is, small relative to the market. Because each trader is small relative to the market, and knows that they’re small, they believe that nothing they do will affect the market price. They willingly express their true preferences: when they are asked “How much would you buy if the price were x?,”
* The buyers collectively define the demand curve (seeking to buy much at low prices, and little at high prices). The sellers define the supply curve. The price at which the total quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied defines the equilibrium price and quantity.
* The process of arriving at the equilibrium point is (in principle at least) accomplished by an auctioneer. The auctioneer calls out a price, and asks, “Who wants to buy at this price? Who wants to sell?” The auctioneer than adjusts the price until total supply and demand are in balance, and the market clears.
* Stocks are held by thousands of investors, and thou- sands more might be standing by as potential buyers or sellers. While millions of people might hold a security, only a few might be actively participating in the market when we want to trade.
* Ultimately the number of market participants might be as low as two: ourselves and our counter- party. All of a sudden, the large-number perfect-competition abstraction seems less relevant. We’re behaving strategically, taking into account the fact that our actions can change the price.
* Most of the time there is no one acting as an “auctioneer”. In these interactions, the market procedure and rules matter very much.

# The Elements of a Securities Market: US Equities
* When we multiply the number of shares in a firm by the price per share, we arrive at the firm’s equity market, the market value of all the firm’s shares. We can total this number for all the firms in a country to get a country’s equity capitalization, and total all the countries in the world to get a global figure.
* Market capitalization is a “point in time” measure. Trading volume, though, is generally measured as a flow: shares (or dollars) traded per unit time.
* Market capitalization and trading volume are positively related. This is to be expected be- cause shares in large firms would be widely held and actively traded.
* An intuitive measure of trading activity that looks beyond this effect is turnover.
  * Turnover is the ratio of trading volume to market capitalization.
  * For a single firm, this is equivalent to the ratio of share volume to the number of shares outstanding. Because volume is a rate, turnover has a time dimension. The NYSE’s annual turnover of 1.7 (170%) suggests that share of stock was traded, on average, 1.7 times over the year.
  * It is more probable that most of the shares did not change hands during the year, while some shares were traded ten or more times.
  * A high turnover corresponds to short holding periods. With an average turnover of 4.5 times per year


### Exchanges
* An exchange usually consists of facilities for trading, such as a trading floor, software that defines the market or connects traders, and so on. An exchange establishes a regularization of the trading process.
* Most exchange activity revolves around three areas: listing, trading and data
  * When a firm lists on an exchange, the exchange is providing a kind of sponsorship. The firm pays a listing fee. In return the exchange provides trading services, and monitors and certifies financial statements and governance procedures.
  * The trading services and facilities comprise computer systems, standardized trading procedures, and a certain amount of oversight.
  * The trading generates market data: reports of trades, quote changes, and so on. These data are valuable for market participants, and their sale generates large revenues.
* A firm usually lists with one exchange, or at least designates one as the primary listing exchange.
* The most important US listing venues are the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT, and NASDAQ.
  * The NYSE has the highest fees and tightest listing standards.
  * NYSE was historically the dominant US exchange, home to the “blue chip” companies, the largest and oldest industrial and financial companies.
    * An NYSE listing carries associations of seniority and stability.
  * NASDAQ-listed companies tend to be younger, smaller and more concentrated in technology.
    * A NASDAQ listing carries associations of “entrepreneurial” and “growth”.
  * The American Stock Exchange (now NYSE MKT) historically occupied the space between the NYSE and NASDAQ.
* In the hypothetical corporate life cycle, a firm would first list on NASDAQ, move to the Amex when it grew a little larger, and ultimately step up to the NYSE.
* From a listing perspective, NYSE Arca represents a NYSE initiative to list companies whose profile comes closer to NASDAQ.
* In its materials, the NYSE commented, “NYSE Arca is a fully electronic exchange for growth-oriented enterprises. Listed companies can grow on NYSE Arca and transfer seamlessly to the NYSE once they meet the requirements.”
* For trading purposes, a security is identified by its ticker symbol.
  * Most NYSE-classic and Amex stock listings have ticker symbols of three letters or less, like IBM, GE, or C (Citigroup);
  * most NASDAQ- and ARCA-listed stocks have four-letter symbols, like MSFT (Microsoft), INTC (Intel), and QCOM (Qualcom).
  * Options and futures have more complicated symbols that encode references to maturity or exercise price.  
* owning a share of the exchange does not confer trading privileges, and you can trade without owning any shares.

### Broker
* We can’t trade simply by visiting an exchange’s web site and giving a credit-card number. For a number of legal and practical reasons, the exchange requires a more substantial relationship, one that verifies our identity, capability, and authority to trade. Most customers establish this rela- tionship indirectly, by setting up an account with a broker.
