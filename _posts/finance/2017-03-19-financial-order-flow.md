# Execution
* An execution is the completion of a buy or sell order for a security. The execution of an order happens when it is completely filled, not when it is placed by the investor.
* When the investor places the trade, it goes to a broker, who then determines the best way for it to be executed.
* Brokers are required by law to give investors the best execution possible and can attempt to execute the transaction in the following ways:
  * Order to the Floor - For stocks trading on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the broker can direct your order to the floor of the stock exchange, or to a regional exchange. In some instances regional exchanges will pay a fee for the privilege to execute a broker's order, known as payment for order flow. Because your order is going through human hands, it can take some time for the floor broker to get to your order and fill it.
  * Order to Third Market Maker - For stocks trading on an exchange like the NYSE, your brokerage can direct your order to what is called a third market maker. A third market maker is likely to receive the order if: A) they entice the broker with an incentive to direct the order to them or B) the broker is not a member firm of the exchange in which the order would otherwise be directed.
  * Internalization - Internalization occurs when the broker decides to fill your order from the inventory of stocks your brokerage firm owns. This can make for quick execution. This type of execution is accompanied by your broker's firm making additional money on the spread.
  * Electronic Communications Network (ECN) - ECNs automatically match buy and sell orders. These systems are used particularly for limit orders because the ECN can match by price very quickly.
  * Order to Market Maker - For over-the-counter markets such as the Nasdaq, your broker can direct your trade to the market maker in charge of the stock you wish to purchase or sell. This is usually timely, and some brokers make additional money by sending orders to certain market makers (payment for order flow). This means your broker may not always be sending your order to the best possible market maker.

# Payment for order flow
* In financial markets payment for order flow refers to the compensation that a broker receives, not from its client, but from a third party that wants to influence how the broker routes client orders
* Market makers such as dealers and securities exchanges are willing to pay a broker for the right to transact with that broker's clients because they believe those clients will be uninformed traders—retail or other investors who are trading because of emotion or the need to raise cash and not because they know an asset is misvalued.
* By purchasing what it expects to be uninformed order flow, a market-maker can buy at the bid and sell at the ask with less risk of trading at a loss than with an informed trader who knows that the market is mispricing the security.
* Thus, market-makers who pay for order flow can capture the spread while reducing the risk that the spread is too narrow to adequately compensate them for the risk of loss.

# Electronic Communication Network (ECN)
* An electronic communication network (ECN) is an automated system that matches buy and sell orders for securities. It connects major brokerages and individual traders so they can trade directly between themselves without going through a middleman and make it possible for investors in different geographic locations to quickly and easily trade with each other.
* ECNs are computer-based systems that display the best available bid and ask quotes from multiple market participants, and then automatically match and execute orders. They not only facilitate trading on major exchanges during market hours, they are also used for after-hours trading and foreign currency trading. ECNs allow for automated trading, passive order matching and speedy execution.

# Pinging
* buy-side firms use algorithmic trading systems to break up large orders into much smaller ones and feed them steadily into the market so as to reduce the market impact of large orders. In order to detect the presence of such large orders, HFT firms place bids and offers in 100-share lots for every listed stock.

* Once a firm gets a “ping” (i.e. the HFT’s small order is executed) or series of pings that alerts the HFT to the presence of a large buy-side order, it may engage in a predatory trading activity that ensures it a nearly risk-free profit at the expense of the buy-sider, who will end up receiving an unfavorable price for its large order. Pinging has been likened to “baiting” by some influential market players, since its sole purpose is to lure institutions with large orders to reveal their hand.


# Smart Order Routers
* Smart order routers (SORs) emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the U.S. equities markets. As traders came to understand that certaivn kinds of trades could be better handled by certain market centers, they began hard coding instructions into their trading systems accordingly.
* This routing happens all along the trade process and is reported with varying degrees of transparency. The retail broker must disclose, in broad terms, where it sent customer orders in what is known as a Rule 606 Report.
* The market centers themselves may, in turn, route orders away to other market centers. This information, along with details about the quality of executions on a stock-by-stock basis, is disclosed in what are known as Rule 605 Disclosure reports.


# Riskless Principal

* Riskless principal is a trade in a security that involves two orders, with the execution of one of these orders dependent upon the receipt or execution of the other.
* Riskless principal is defined by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) as **a trade in which a member who has received a customer order immediately executes an identical order in the marketplace, while taking on the role of principal, in order to fill the customer order.**
* A buy order from a customer would therefore require the member firm to execute an identical buy order in the market as principal, while a sell order would require the member firm to execute an identical sell order in the market.
* In order to qualify for riskless principal trades, FINRA stipulates that the trades should be executed at the same price, exclusive of a markup/markdown, commission or other fees.

* For example, a broker-dealer who is a FINRA member and receives a customer order to buy 10,000 shares of Widget Co. at the prevailing market price of $10 would immediately buy the 10,000 shares from another member at $10. Since both trades were executed at the same price (excluding commissions), this would qualify as a riskless principal transaction.

# Proprietary Trading
* Proprietary trading occurs when a firm or bank invests for its own direct gain instead of earning commission dollars by trading on behalf of its clients. * This type of trading occurs when a firm decides to profit from the market rather than from the thin-margin commissions it makes from processing trades. Firms or banks that engage in proprietary trading believe that they have a competitive advantage that will enable them to earn excess returns.
* Proprietary trading, also known as prop trading, happens when a trading desk at a large financial institution — often an brokerage firm or an investment bank — uses the organization's own capital and balance sheet to conduct financial transactions. These trades are usually speculative in nature, and the products are often derivatives or other complex investment vehicles.
* In order for proprietary trading to be effective and also keep the institution's clients in mind, the proprietary trading desk are normally secluded from other trading desks. This desk is responsible for a portion of the financial institution's revenues unrelated to any client work and acts somewhat autonomously.
  * However, proprietary trading desks can function as a market maker, outlined above. This situation arises when a client wants to trade a large amount of a single security or trade a highly illiquid security. Since there aren't many buyers or sellers for this type of trade, a proprietary trading desk will act as the buyer or seller, initiating the other side of the client trade.

##### Benefit of proprietary trading
* Fist, When a brokerage firm or investment bank trades on behalf of its clients, it earns revenues in the form of fees and commission dollars. These dollars can either be soft or hard, but they are normally a very small percentage of the total amount invested or the gains generated. Proprietary trading, on the other hand, allows an institution to realize 100% of the gains earned from an investment.
* The second benefit is that the institution is able to stockpile an inventory of securities. This helps in two ways. First, any speculative inventory allows the institution to offer it to its clients when it might not have had it otherwise. Second, it helps these institutions prepare for down or illiquid markets when it becomes hard to purchase securities on the open market.
* The final benefit is associated with the second. Proprietary trading allows a financial institution to become an influential market maker by providing liquidity on a specific security or group of securities.

# Held
* A reference to a long position in a security. The term "held," in the investment context, refers to securities or assets owned by an investor or trader. It may also refer to a situation where a security is temporarily unavailable for trading. In the latter case, the term "held" may not be used in isolation, but may be part of a larger, more descriptive term such as "held at the opening."
* Stocks "held" generally refer to long positions or securities owned by investors, as opposed to short positions which may be referred to as stocks "sold short."
* The term also appears as a matter of routine disclosure in the investment press. For example, in an article where an investment guru or other individual is expounding on his or her top picks, the disclosure about whether the writer held a long position in the stocks being discussed, would usually appear at the end of the article.

# Not Held
* A not-held order is a market or limit order that gives the broker or floor trader both time and price discretion to attempt to get the best possible price.
* A person placing a not-held order exhibits great faith that the floor trader will be able to attain a better price than the current one. Although the floor trader has price and time discretion, he or she cannot be responsible for any losses that the shareholder may suffer as a result of this type of order. Often this type of order is applied to international equities to the fact that shareholders trust the trader's judgment more than they trust their own.
