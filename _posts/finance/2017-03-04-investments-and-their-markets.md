# Common Stock
###### Intro
* A share of common stock represents a `proportional ownership interest` in a corporation
  * If a corporation has 1000 shares outstanding and you own one, you own 1/100th of the company.
* A company can change the number of shares outstanding either by selling additional shares or by buying back and canceling some of the shares previously issued. In either case your proportional interest in the ownership of the company also changes.
  * Following the above example, if the company subsequently issues another 100 shares, your ownership drops 1/200, which means your interest in the company is diluted by the issuance of the new shares.
* When the shares are sold by the company, the shares are said to be offered in a `primary distribution`, `primary offering` or `primary market`. After the initial sale, the shares trade among investors in the so-called `secondary market`. The company on get the `price x shares` outstanding in the primary market, no proceeds (gains or loss) from any sales of the same shares.
* Shares that the company sells to investors are said to be `issued`.
* Shares that are issued and not retired are called `issued and outstanding`.
* Stock that has been repurchased by the issuing company but not retired (original company holds its shares as investors) is called `treasury stock`.

##### Characteristics
* Limited liability: the worst case for investors is the value of the stock go to zero, which means investors cannot lose more than 100% of their investment. (No matter how much money the company loses or how many of the company's bills go unpaid)
* Voting privileges: shares owners elect a `board of directors` to represent them =>  One member of the board is elected `chairman of the board`, who is responsible for running the directors meetings. The board acting on behalf of the shareholders, hires managers to operate on the company. Most corporate actions require only the approval of a majority of the board of directors. The board can decide to hire a certain management team, make an acquisition, divest a division or sell the entire company to another company. So any groups of shareholders with enough votes to elect a majority of the board of directors has effective control over the entire company.
* Claims in bankruptcy: If the company goes bankrupt, the common shareholders is the last to get paid.
* Dividend policy: Board of directors decide the dividend payments.
