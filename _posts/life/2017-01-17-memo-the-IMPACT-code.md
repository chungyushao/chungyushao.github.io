# `I`: In the room
##### The logic
* In order to move forward we must learn to forgive the past.
* The first step to getting more from your future is to simply acknowledge your past.
* The easiest way to step forward and leave the past behind is to be in the room.

##### The past
* We are all either permanent inhabitants of the past or we worry way too much about the future and what might happen.
* Everything that happens to us shapes who we are, but not always for the better.
* Experiences can only help us when we put it where it belongs -- in the past.
* There is no such thing as failure, there are only results.

##### The present
* We have to learn to ignore the negativity that spouts forth from the Commentator (past voice) and start developing the Coach (present voice) within us.
* When you are in the middle of a situation forget about the future. The only place you can be is here and now and you have to make the most of every minute of every day.
* When you focus your energy on the present the future will start taking care of itself.
* We think much more about the use of our money, which is renewable, than we do about the use of our time, which is irreplaceable.

##### Take the good things from the past
* Difficult situations or things that hurt our feelings seem to leave a much deeper impression on our consciousness than good experiences.
* It is far too easy to overlook our own successes.
* Visualize success, imagine how it will feel, practice remembering positive experiences.

##### `E + R = O`
* `E + R = O` means that the Events or Experiences in our life plus the Response we give it equal our Outcome.
* If you don't like how you are feeling about an Event, change your response and you will see that you get a different outcome to the one you feared. This will allow you to be in control of NOW.
* No-one can make us feel inferior without our prior consent.

```
##### Anyway
People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered;
Forgive them anyway.

If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
Be kind anyway.

If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;
Succeed anyway.

If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;
Be honest and frank anyway.

What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;
Build anyway.

If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
Be happy anyway.

The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
Do good anyway.

Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;
Give the world the bet you've got anyway.

You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God;
It was never between you and them anyway.
```

# `M`: Model from the best
* Fake it till you make it.
* Our natural urge is to think about what we Don't want. I don't want to get fat, I don't want to get hurt and I don't want to be laughed at. Consequently, our focus is firmly directed on avoiding trouble.
* If you combine the power of your imagination to help create a positive emotional response to a scenario that would ordinarily frighten you, the results will be dramatic and quick. That is why modeling is so powerful.
* We spent so long worrying about risk and dodging danger, we rarely take the time to focus on what we do want. Avoiding trouble is not the same as getting a good result.

##### Modeling, ask "what" questions
* The emphasis is on attitude response rather than just a checklist of activities.
* It doesn't really matter what they achieve, but rather, it is what they do to help them achieve it that is important.
* It is not about "how" I did it, but what I had to do to enable my own success.
* Example:
  * What do you say to yourself before an important call or meeting?
  * What picture do you have in your mind?
  * What do you hear the customer saying?
  * What do you do if things go wrong?

##### The logic
* Working on your life is a constant, never-ending process.
* The quality of your lie will largely depend on the quality of your goals.
* Whether your goals are reached or not will largely depend on your actions.
* Whether you take action or not will largely depend on your desire and commitments.
* Whether you keep your commitments or not will largely depend on who you commit to.
* Who you commit to will largely depend on faith trust and love.
* When faith, trust, and love exist, your life becomes a masterpiece.

##### Quantum-leap your results
`desire + deadline + focus + massive action + mastermind commitment = success`
* Make a good solid list of reasons why you want what you say you want.
* When your "whys" are strong enough, your "whats" begin to happen!
* Focus on the task at hand and get BUSY!


# `P`: Passion & Purpose

* Without passion, purpose means nothing. Without purpose, passion is utterly wasted.
* Responsibility is not an excuse for giving up on our dreams, but it is the one we all tout as the root cause of malaise.
* Blaming everyone else for your sacrifice is a nonsense that has to stop right now.
* Apart from your family and friends, the people we tend to remember are normally those individuals who are filled with energy and enthusiasm for life. People who live for themselves make incredible life partners.
* Break your task down into bite-size pieces and you will get it done. Spend too long thinking about the enormity of the whole task and you won't get anything done.
* People who excel in life are those who produce RESULTS, not REASONS.
* Anybody can come up with excuses and explanations for why they haven't made it; those who want to succeed badly enough don't make excuses.
* "Is what I am doing right now going to get me where I need to be?"
* "If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain."
* We teach people how to treat us. Teaching them how to treat you is taking positive action and preventing them from sabotaging your plans or your health.


##### Passionate people have genuine enthusiasm.
* They want to accomplish something.
* They have energy, commitment and pride.
* They have self-discipline.
* They are willing to work hard and to go the "extra mile".
* They have a burning desire to succeed. They are willing to do whatever it takes.
* They are highly motivated towards an achievement.
* They take great satisfaction in accomplishing a task.
* They are focused. They concentrate on their main goals and objectives. They don't get side-tracked.
* They don't procrastinate. They work on the projects that are important and don't allow those projects to sit until the last minute.
* They are productive, not just busy.
* They work on Number 1.
* They learn how to get things done.
* They do things that need to be done, not just the things they like to do.
* They take responsibility for their actions. They don't make excuses. They don't blame others and they don't whine and complain.
* They look for solutions to problems.
* They make decisions. They think about the issues and relevant facts, give them adequate deliberation and consideration, and make a decision.
* They have the courage to admit they've made a mistake.
* They have the skills, talent, and training that is needed in order to be successful.
...

##### Questions to find your purpose
* What is my passion?
* What are my bite-size goals?
* What mechanism will help me get there?
* What Action do I need to take?
* What will the result look like?
* Is this my truth?

# `A`: Action
* Positive thinking can only help you deal with life; it can never make your life happen.
* Ask yourself honestly if there isn't one thing -- no matter how small -- you could do today, right now, to take you a step closer to your dream.
* Before you take action you have to sort out your commitment issues. Your commitment to yourself. Love yourself enough to make some real commitments to you.

# `C`: Comic relief


* Taking a light-hearted approach to life and works is the surest way to earn the respect of those around you. If you can smile in the face of adversity and forgive when others tell you that you shouldn't, then the world will be your oyster.
* The more important the job, the more difficult the challenge, the bigger my smile has to be. It works.
* Fun doesn't start with a whoopee cushion, it starts with not taking yourself too seriously.
* People will see what you want them to see. If you are smart and happy -- live that way. Serious does not have to mean grumpy.
* Look for the good in life and you will find it, look for the good in people and they will show you the good in them and the good in you.

##### The risk poem
```
To laugh is to risk appearing a fool,
To cry is to risk appearing sentimental and soft,
To reach out to another is to risk involvement,
To show up and expose your feelings is to risk exposing your inherent self,
To place your ideas, your dreams, your desires before people is to risk their loss,
To love is to risk not being loved in return,
To show strength is to risk showing weakness,
To do is to risk failure.
The greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing,
The person who risks nothing gets nothing, has nothing, is nothing.
He may avoid suffering, pain, sorrow, but he does not live, he does not love,
He has sold, forfeited freedom, integrity,
He is a slave, chained by safety, locked away by fear.
Because only a person who is willing to risk not knowing the result is FREE.
```

# `T`: Trust
* When you believe you can do it, you will and you will start to see how much others can do to help you and how much you can help them in return.
* Know the limitations of your trust and don't allow the person you are trusting to step outside of that zone until they have proven to you that they are worthy of more.
* Things that happen around us are usually nothing to do with us.
* When you are knocked back you need, to be honest about why and not allow your emotional response to rejection or hurt to stop you moving forward.
* You have to do it by yourself, and you can't do it alone.
* Getting more IMPACT means allowing people into your world; opening up to vulnerability and empowering your circle of trusted friends and peers to help you achieve your dreams.
* There must be some sort of order, if not an omnipresent power, in the universe.
* Sometimes we don't need all the answers, we just need to trust the process. We need to put ourselves out into the universe and trust the process.
