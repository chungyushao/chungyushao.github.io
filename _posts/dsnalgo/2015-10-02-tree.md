# Tree

## Resouces:
[Wiki](https://goo.gl/Oxx1r8)

## Definition:
- A tree is a (possibly non-linear) data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges **without having any cycle**.

## Terminologies Reminder:
- Level – The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between the node and the root).
- Height of tree –The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
- Height of node –The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.
- Depth –The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.

## Traversal:
  - subjective is ROOT!!!
  - check with the iterative solution in tree traversal!
  
### Pre-order
  - `pre`: root first
  - Root->Left->Right => Root=>pre(L)=>pre(R)
  - [(M) 144 Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/) // basic traverse

### In-order:
  - `in`: root middle
  - Left->Root->Right  => in(L)=>Root=>in(R)
  - [(M) 94 Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/) // basic traverse
### Post-order:
  - `post`: root last
  - Left->Right->Root => post(L)=>post(R)=>Root
  - [(H) 145 Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/) // basic traverse

## Binary Search Tree:

## Think about the recursion base case!! FUN!

[(E) 101 Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)
  - double dfs!
  - dfs(left.left, right.right) and dfs(left.right, right.left)!! Damn clever DFS!

[(E) 100 Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)
  - double dfs again!

[(E) 104 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
  - Got nice Solution to train you recursive-thinking!!!

[(E) 111 Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
  - Similar to maximum, but need to be careful that it needs to be counted through leaf node!
  - maximum won't have this kind of constraint, think about tree [1, 2]

[(E) 226 Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

[(M) 156 Binary Tree Upside Down](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-upside-down/) //[my post](https://goo.gl/nWjB11)

## Damn...

[(M) 222 Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)
  - haven't fighre out the ultimal solution.
  - ur sol: if it's not complete, break down to sub, it will eventually being a complete tree

[(M) 105 Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)
  - [My post](https://goo.gl/AtkHMl)
    - Divide and Conquer!!
    - For tree [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `preorder` = [1,2,4,5,3], `inorder` = [4,2,5,1,3]
    - the key thought is that you can get the root from preorder first => `1`
    - Then in `inorder` would be split by `1` to left-subtree [4,2,5] and right-subtree [3]
[(M) 106 Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/)
  - Just the same concept with 105

[(M) 236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree]((M) 236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree)
  - [God's recursion...awesome](https://goo.gl/rYhikc)
    - Need further check with it... Possible Thoughts:
      - if common ancestor is root, p/q must under left and q/p must under right
      - same, if one of return from left/right is None, then p, q must be in the same side
      - kinda like top-down thoughts of recursive...
